# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose 
"The purpose of the new analysis is well defined"
The purpose of this analysis it to provide the PyBer CEO with analysis of total ride data including number of rides, drivers, fares, average fare per rider and average fare per driver over the course of five months in 2019 for each type of city (rural, urban, and suburban) in order to identiy trends. The second part of this analysis analyzes the data by weeks over the course of four months in 2019 in order to provide business recommendations to the CEO of PyBer.

## Results 
 
### Ride-Share Data

For the first analysis, we needed to provide a statistic overview and summary of the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Rider, and Average Fare per Driver.

Some of the key findings from this summary include: 
- Urban cities have almost 13x more total rides than rural cities indicating a significant higher demand for rides than in rural cities. 
- Total Drivers is consistent with total rides in that Urban cities have 4x more drivers than in suburban cities, and over 30x more than in rural cities.  
- Total Fares also correlates with total drivers and total fares, with Urban cities having the highest revenue. 
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver, and urban cities have the lowest average fair per ride and driver. 

### Analysis 
With the higher demand and the higher number of drivers in urban cities, the average fare is also going to be lower, as indicated above. The higher the demand, the lower the cost will be for the rider. In the rural areas, it is just the opposite. In order to make any profit and to have the ability to use the PyBer within rural areas, PyBer must increase the amount per ride in order to be able to pay for the drivers' wages, as well as feed into the company's overall revenue. 




## Summary 
"There is a statement summarizing three buseness recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types."
