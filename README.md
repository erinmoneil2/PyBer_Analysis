# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis it to provide the PyBer CEO with analysis of total ride data including number of rides, drivers, fares, average fare per rider and average fare per driver over the course of five months in 2019 for each type of city (rural, urban, and suburban) in order to identiy trends. The second part of this analysis analyzes the data by weeks over the course of four months in 2019 in order to provide business recommendations to the CEO of PyBer.

## Results 
 
### Ride-Share Data

For the first analysis, we needed to provide a statistic overview and summary of the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Rider, and Average Fare per Driver.

Some of the key findings from this summary include: 
- Urban cities have almost 13x more total rides than rural cities indicating a significant higher demand for rides than in rural cities. 
- Total Drivers is consistent with total rides in that Urban cities have 4x more drivers than in suburban cities, and over 30x more than in rural cities.  
- Total Fares also correlates with total drivers and total fares, with Urban cities having the highest revenue. 
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver, and urban cities have the lowest average fair per ride and driver. 

### Analysis 
With the higher demand and the higher number of drivers in urban cities, the average fare is also going to be lower, as indicated above. The higher the demand, the lower the cost will be for the rider. In the rural areas, it is just the opposite. In order to make any profit and to have the ability to use the PyBer within rural areas, PyBer must increase the amount per ride in order to be able to pay for the drivers' wages, as well as feed into the company's overall revenue. 

### Weekly Ride Share Data 
In order to visualize this data, we can also present it to the PyBer CEO to show fares weekly over the course of four months.

This multiple line chart further supports the findings and trends of fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities. It depicts that the total fare for urban cities is roughly 6x higher every week from Janurary to the end of April. It also shows, unlike the previous chart, that all of the city types have similiar patterns in their peaks with the highest being towards mid to end February.


## Summary 

Rural city income only accounts for roughly 6.8% of PyBer's total revenue. THere is a significantly less use of PyBer services in rural areas, and this could be due to higher fares in rural areas and may discourage riders from using this service. One recommendation would be to end operations in rural cities and allocate those drivers to urban cities and see an increase in overall revenue because the demand is much higher, and would increase both total rides, as well as total revenue. Another recommendation would be to ADD more drivers to rural areas. If PyBer increased the number of drivers within rural areas, then they would be able to decrease the fare for riders, although the higher fares could also be due to traveling longer distances. Ina ddition, if PyBer added more drivers to rural areas, they would risk losing revenue in the case that the demand did not increase, but the number of drivers did. It would also be beneficial to do some analysis on whether the fares were calculated as 1 mile or 1 minute. If they were done by milage, the rural fares would naturally be higher, and the urban fares would be lower, as riders generally driver shorter distances in urban areas. In which case, it might be good to do analysis on whether have fares by minute in urban areas would increase revenue.
